StealYourCarbon is a simple reagent restocker addon.  When you visit a vendor who sells an item you have told SYC to buy, it buys it for you.  Never run out of water again!

Future plans: restocking from bank.

What the hell does the name mean?  Just an amusing little phrase I stole from "Modest Mouse - Parting of the Sensory":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRFe1yPfWK8
